## Student Pairing Algorithm

Objective: Given a list of student pairings of happiness and stress levels, how do you effeciently maximize happiness across all groups without any group exceeding a given StressMax / # of Created Groups.

In other words, F(StressMax, StudentHapAndStressJSON] = Number of groups and which students in each group.

We created an effecient solution that utilizes dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. Check it out!
